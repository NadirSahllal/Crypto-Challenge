This was a challenge that We put in a security competition that was held in Rabat, as I was part of the organizing comitee.
The chalenge is that they need to reverse ingener the given file and get the secret key to be able to decrypt it.
The code was written as a colaboration between me and a friend of mine.
The code is done in C++. 
 
 As to give a more in detail explaination about the code:
 The code is relatively hard to understand, that is mainly because as i specified it is used for a security challenge(and if solved you will get points equivalents to all the rest of the chalenges combined, sloving it would have meant winning).
 Durring the challenge we give to the participants the executable code, and they need to uncompile it to somewhat get a version of the sourse code. and from the result of the uncompilation they need to figure out the methode used to encrypt the message. Then figure out the key to have the message "congrats !!! You have successfully removed Excalibur from the stone !!!".
 You will find the Key for the challenge in the file "magic".
 The challenge was fairly difficult, and we were a little mean in it as we have added a lot of complication to make it that much worth it.
